##  Final Requirements

- [x] PostgreSQL + Prisma  
- [x] Custom API (CRUD for moods & goals)  
- [x] Group features (friend mood visibility)  
- [x] GitHub repo + Vercel deployment  
- [x] Environment variables + `.gitignore`  


##  How CRUD Works

This app uses custom API routes under `/api/` to handle full CRUD operations for both moods and goals:

- **Create**: Users can submit a form to add a new mood log or goal via a `POST` request.
- **Read**: Mood and goal entries are retrieved using `GET` requests from the database using Prisma.
- **Update**: Goals can be marked as complete/incomplete using a `PATCH` request. The checkbox in the UI toggles the `completed` field in the database.
- **Delete**: Entries can be deleted using a `DELETE` request via a button in the UI.

All operations are handled with proper error catching and JSON responses inside `app/api/moods/route.ts` and `app/api/goals/route.ts`.
